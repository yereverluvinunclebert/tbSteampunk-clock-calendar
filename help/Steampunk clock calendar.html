Welcome to the Steampunk Clock Calendar Widget.</big><br />
<br />
<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" />The 
Steampunk Clock Calendar VB6/TwinBasic widget is a useful utility displaying a clock 
/calendar in a decidedly Steampunk fashion on your desktop. It can be resized 
and placed anywhere on your desktop. It uses minimal resources and helps give 
your desktop a Steampunk make-over.
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">
On modern systems the CPU usage of this widget is negligible less being than 
0.9% (i7 6700K @4ghz). &nbsp;</span>This help file describes just the Clock/Calendar 
widget and not the other widgets shown above. The others are a mix of 
	VB6/TwinBasic/TwinBasic 
binaries and javascript desktop widgets that will be converted to 
	VB6/TwinBasic/TwinBasic 'widgets' 
one at a time as time allows<br />
<br />
This version was developed on Windows 7/10 using 32 bit VisualBasic 6 and 
	TwinBasic as a FOSS 
project, creating a WoW64 widget for the desktop. This version will run on 
Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10 and 11+. There will also be a separate version for 
Windows XP and ReactOS. These latter versions will not the option for 
DPI-awareness, otherwise they will operate exactly the same.<br />
<br />
It is open source to allow easy configuration, bug-fixing, enhancement and 
community contribution towards a set of free-and-useful VB6/TwinBasic utilities that can 
be created by anyone. The next step is conversion of each to TwinBasic 64 for 
future-proofing. <br />
<br />
This utility is one of a set of steampunk and Steampunk widgets. That you can 
find them all here on Deviantart:

<br />
I do hope you enjoy using this utility and others. Your own software 
enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received if you ever choose to 
contribute.<br />

	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" />When 
	you run the installer a splash screen will appear for 1 brief second, then 
	it will suggest default locations where you can install this utility. When 
	the installation is complete it will run the program. That is it.<br />
	<br />
	To uninstall the program, there is an uninstall.exe that will remove the 
	application for you in the program folder. If you ever want to to reinstall 
	a new version of the program, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
	always uninstall the old version beforehand</span>.<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Anti Virus Tools</h3>
	<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" /> 
	When you install the Steampunk Clock Calendar Widget for the first time you 
	will need to accept that your anti-virus tool will pause the installation to 
	test the installation program for malware. Due to this program being written 
	in VB6/TwinBasic and being a new program your a/v tool has not encountered, it WILL 
	flag it as being potentially malware. This is a FALSE POSITIVE. This occurs 
	with such tools as Avast or similar, see below.<br />
	<br />
	If you do not feel at ease with running this tool with an exception for 
	malware scans, then I suggest <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you 
	uninstall it and instead only run software you trust</span>. To help you 
	gain that trust, the source code for this utility is available for you and 
	others to view on github. You can view and edit that code at your leisure 
	and you can even compile the code for yourself. This should give you the 
	confidence that you need. There is a link on the tool's right click menu 
	that will take you straight through to the github page here:
	<a href="https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Diesel-Volume-Control-VB6">
	https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Steampunk-Volume-Control-VB6/TwinBasic</a><br />
	<br />
	The a/v tool I have installed for testing on my PC is Avast - that is an a/v 
	tool that many will have installed. The following&nbsp;is what 
	occurs during installation on my system: You download and run the 
	clockCalendarInstaller.EXE which is the installer for this program. When Avast first encounters the file it will test 
	it for malware, it takes approx. 20-30 seconds 
	to complete a scan. Let it finish. It should find no trace of malware. Once done, the 
	clockCalendarInstaller will then perform the 
	installation and when completed it will attempt to run the Steampunk Clock Calendar 
	and place it on your desktop At this point Avast may do another scan to test 
	the Steampunk Clock/Calendar Widget program binary (the Steampunk Clock 
	Calendar.exe file) which will 
	take another 30 seconds or so. When that second scan is complete you should 
	find the Steampunk Clock/Calendar on your desktop running nomally.<br />
	<br />
	Until the Avast databases are updated and it fully trusts the program, Avast 
	may try to scan it <span class="auto-style3">every time it is run.</span> This is a pain but it will 
	eventually go away. In the meantime, if you want to prevent your a/v tool 
	from scanning (and being continually intrusive on a trusted program such as 
	this) then you will need to set an exception or an exclusion within Avast 
	(whichever anti-virus tool you use). &nbsp;Eventually, the creators of the 
	various a/v tools will become familiar with this particular utility and the 
	binary will no longer raise any false positives nor alarms. <br />
	<br />
	This is a new VB6/TwinBasic utility so it is an inevitable occurrence - being a new 
	and unknown binary, it is of course&nbsp;frustrating but it will eventually go 
	away.&nbsp;<br />

	<h3>Basic Functionality</h3>
	<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" />When 
	you install and run the widget for the first time it will present you with 
	the licence screen and launch the prefs. You must accept the licence terms 
	to proceed further.&nbsp; The Clock/Calendar will also appear on your main 
	monitor, animating slowly using minimal resources. This widget size can be 
	increased in size (press the CTRL key in combination with the mouse 
	scrollwheel UP/DOWN to resize), animation speed can be changed, 
	opacity/transparency may be set as to the user's discretion. The widget can 
	also be made to hide for a pre-determined period. If the application is 
	already running then you can double-click to run a new instance of the 
	binary and you will have two or more Clock/Calendars running on the desktop. 
	As each Steampunk Clock/Calendar running program is a mere desktop 'Widget', 
	each instance will not appear on the taskbar unless you configure it to do 
	so. Widgets tend to operate underneath all your other programs and sit 
	quietly on the desktop doing their thing.<br />

	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig&nbsp;01b. The Help Parchment being shown.</span><br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	Alarm Flag (1) <br />
	<br />
	</span>If an alarm is being displayed then an alarm flag will display at 
	this position giving the number of the alarm.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Weekday</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Flag (2) <br />
	<br />
	</span>If you press the weekday toggle a weekday indicator will pop up to 
	display the day of the week.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Display Console</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (3) <br />
	<br />
	</span>The display console informs the user of the clock's internal 
	functions as they occur. Think of it as a debug console that displays the 
	inner workings of the program. If you double-click on the screen, it will 
	send a carriage return and roll up the text one line.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Screeen Toggle</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (4) <br />
	<br />
	</span>The screen toggle controls the display console, press it and the 
	console elements will retract and disappear. Press it again and it will 
	reappear.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Back Screeen Toggle</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (5)
	<br />
	<br />
	</span>The back screen can be raised or lowered.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Back Screeen</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (6) <br />
	<br />
	</span>The back screen when elevated, allows the transparent console display 
	to be viewed on darker backgrounds.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Alarm Bell (7) <br />
	<br />
	</span>If you press the alam bell it emits a 'ding' but nothing more, 
	however, in 'alarm edit' mode it sets and confirms the current alarm.<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	The Alarm Switch (8) <br />
	<br />
	</span>If you press the alam switch then it will switch the&nbsp;whole clock into 
	alarm mode and raise the currently selected alarm. It will also free the 
	time slider, allowing you to advance or retard time as you require.<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	Digital Time Display (9) <br />
	<br />
	</span>The digital time display will show the current time in 12 or 24 hour 
	clock according to your preference. When in alarm mode it will display the 
	time of the currently active alarm.<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	Date Display (10) <br />
	<br />
	</span>The date display will show the current date in standard dd/mmm/yyyy 
	manner. When in alarm mode it will display the date of the currently active 
	alarm.<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	Morning/Afternoon (11) <br />
	<br />
	</span>The AM/PM display will show the current time anti or post meridien. When in alarm mode it will display the 
	same for the currently active 
	alarm.<br />
	<br />
	<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Time</strong></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
	Slider (12)</span><br />
	<br />
	The time slider is only freed after you enter alarm mode by pressing the A 
	toggle first. When freed it will centre itself to point 2, the central 
	point.
	To advance or retard the alarm time click on the time slider and drag it left and right 
	within the bounds of the tool. The time displayed will advance or retard 
	accordingly.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
	The Analogue Clock (13)</span><br />
	<br />
	The analogue clock is just that, an ordinary clock. When in alarm mode it 
	will display the time of the currently active alarm.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	<br />
	The Sound Crank (14)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The sound crank has two positions, up and down. When you click on the 
	sound crank it will toggle to the alternative position. Down means quite and 
	up means loud, as in "crank up the volume".<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	<br />
	The Pendulum (15)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The pendulum will swing if you click on the pendulum or the P toggle. 
	Note that the pendulum swing is achieved using maths, ie. code, so that it 
	uses up CPU cycles, possibly 3-4% depending upon the age and power of your 
	CPU. If you want it to use less CPU, click it again to stop.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	<br />
	The Ticking Control (16)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The ticking chain, when pulled produces a regular ticking sound<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span> 
	Pulling it again, will silence the tick.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	<br />
	The Alarm Toggles (17)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The alarm toggles, all five of them are activated by clicking on 
	each. If an alarm has been pre-set then that alarm will be displaye. If 
	there is no alarm set then the clock will display a time of "00:00" and a 
	date of&nbsp; "01 JAN 1970".<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	<br />
	The Set Toggle (18)<br />
	</span>
	<br />
	Press the Alarm Toggle first to start editing an alarm but then press the set toggle 
	that will save any alarm currently being edited, returning the clock back to 
	clock mode.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	<br />
	The Mute Toggle (19)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The mute toggle silences the whole widget including alarm chimes.<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	<br />
	The Locking Nut (20)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The locking nut locks the widget in place upon the desktop. Click it 
	to toggle on/off. This 
	will also store the widget's current X,Y location on the screen, storing 
	these values in the preferences under the Position Tab. If the widget is 
	restarted it will relocate to this position automatically. <br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	Widget Help Toggle (22)</span><br />
	<br />
	When you select this option the brief&nbsp;one-screen help pop-up will appear.as 
	above.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	<br />
	The Author's Notes&nbsp; (23)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The author's notes will be revealed when the pulling ring is clicked 
	upon.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
	<br />
	The Alarm Clapper (24)</span><br />
	<br />
	The alarm clapper can be made to move away from the bell when clicked, 
	silencing only the chimes.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Pendulum Toggle (25)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The pendulum will swing if you click on the pendulum or the P toggle. 
	Note that the pendulum swing is achieved using maths, ie. code, so that it 
	uses up CPU cycles, possibly 3-4% depending upon the age and power of your 
	CPU. If you want it to use less CPU, click it again to stop.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Weekday Indicator (26)<br />
	<br />
	</span>The weekday indicator provides information about the current day, ie. 
	the day number and name.
	<br />

	You will note the use of the&nbsp;Centurion Light SF at 8pt on all the menu 
	images shown in this document. This is the recommended font for use with 
	this utility giving it a suitably old-fashioned feel. You will find the 
	Centurion Light SF font below the clock/calendar program resources folder in 
	the "other" directory. You install this font by double-clicking on the TTF 
	file supplied. If this font is not installed and selected, the default font 
	is Times New Roman.</span></p>

	The about window gives me credit for doing everything but in reality the 
	program comprises a lot of FOSS VB6/TwinBasic code &nbsp;from other developers. I have 
	given credit&nbsp;to the original authors&nbsp;of any code I have used and there is a

	Reveal Widget in Windows Explorer.</span><br />
	<br />
	When you select this option, a file explorer window will open using the 
	folder location where your application is situated. A most useful function 
	to find the application quickly.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reload Widget (F5).</span><br />
	<br />
	This option quietly stops and restarts the Steampunk Clock Calendar Widget. 
	On the rare occasion that the Steampunk Clock Calendar Widget&nbsp;has a tiny 
	problem, possibly due to an unforeseen bug - in that case&nbsp;you can simply 
	reset it by reloading the widget. In addition, if the widget has focus then 
	a key-press on the F5 key will also restart the widget. Be aware this is a 
	soft-reload, just initialising and re-running the main software components.
	<br />
	<br />
	If you want to perform a hard restart, ie. program closing and restarting 
	then you can press SHIFT+R. The program will shutdown and use the restart 
	binary to restart itself.<br />

	This menu option only appears if the DEBUG selection option is ON in the 
	Development Preferences. In the prefs, enter the path here to Just 
	Clock/Calendar widget's .vbp file (a VB6/TwinBasic project file). If the widget's 
	source code has been downloaded from github, unpacked and placed somewhere 
	locally - in addition, if you have installed the VB6/TwinBasic IDE, this menu option 
	will add an option to conveniently launch the VB6/TwinBasic IDE, opening up the 
	project, so you can edit the program, re-code and compile dynamically. &nbsp;A 
	link to the current github location will be found on the update button on 
	the about page of the preferences.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch off my functions &amp; Turn all my 
	functions ON</span><br />
	<br />
	These options are a toggle to stop and start the rotation of the hour, 
	minute, second hands and date functions.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock Widget</span><br />
	<br />
	The widget can be made to lock into place so that it cannot be moved. This 
	will also store the widget's current X,Y location on the screen, storing 
	these values in the preferences under the Position Tab. If the widget is 
	restarted it will relocate to this position automatically.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hide Widget for 'n' Minutes</span><br />
<br />
The&nbsp;widget can be made to&nbsp;hide temporarily so that it does not interfere with 
the running of other programs that&nbsp;require all of your screen space. It will 
re-appear automatically in a pre-determined time. The default time to hide can 
be modified in the settings/preferences, by default it is 1 minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>The Preferences Utility:</h3>
<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" />The 
configuration of the widget is performed using the preference utility. The 
preference utility is an approximate analogue of the Yahoo widget preferences 
screen and replicates much of its functionality. Note: The preferences window is 
sizeable by dragging the right hand corner to the size you require.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
<img alt="prefs-general.jpg" src="prefs-general.jpg" title="prefs-general.jpg" /><br />Fig 07. The General Prefs pane.<br />
<br /></span>
<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">The 
General Panel contains the most important user-configurable items required for 
the program to operate correctly. <br /><br /><br /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Widget Functions:&nbsp;</span>You can enable or 
disable the program's&nbsp;functionality.&nbsp;The function to disable the widget is 
merely here to replicate the functionality of the Yahoo and Xwidget versions of 
this widget. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Start:&nbsp;</span> The auto start option 
allows the widget to automatically run on system restart. The program is very 
slim-line and will have little or no impact on system startup times.<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pendulum Swing: &nbsp;</span>The pendulum swing 
option will cause the pendulum to start animating a simple swing. Note this 
animations uses up precious cpu cycles, so only enable it on fast systems when 
you have plenty of cpu to spare.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Five Alarms: &nbsp;</span>The alarms here can be 
set using the steampunk UI or simply edited here by hand. Starting from the 
left, there is a 'o' button, clicking on it will fill the day/month fields with 
the current date/time. <br />
<br />
When you have set a future date/time for an alarm, when you press the save 
button it will verify each of the alarms as being valid or not. By each of the 
date and time fields is a verify button '&gt;'. Press to verify your date in 
advance.<br />
If any date is not valid or in the past then the save will fail. In this case 
correct the faulty alarm and re-save. <br /><br /></span>
<br />

</span>
<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">The 
configuration panel is the location for optional configuration items. These 
items change how Steampunk Clock Calendar operates. Configure them to suit your 
needs and your mode of operation. You may&nbsp;adjust the widget to a percentage of 
the original size. &nbsp;As an alternative, you can</span> mouse hover over the 
widget itself and press the CTRL key in combination with the mouse scrollwheel 
UP/DOWN to resize.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">The 
scroll-wheel resizing direction is determined here, the direction chosen causes 
the widget to increase in size. &nbsp;<br /><br />The option to show the widget in the taskbar is useful as it allows you to hide 
the taskbar entry for this widget so the taskbar remains uncluttered. Typically 
widgets sit beneath the user's programs populating the "underside of the 
desktop", as it were. You may have 40-50 useful widgets running in the 
background and these operate without polluting the user experience, each being 
slimline in operation. Therefore, it makes no sense to have the taskbar 
cluttered by multiple widgets. This option is here just for those that might run 
one or two such programs and desire to have their widget appearing in the 
taskbar and acting more as an ordinary Windows program (which it really is).<br />
<br />The DPI awareness toggle requires the widget to be 'hard' started in order to 
take effect, ie. a&nbsp;program close and re-open. As well as the main program binary 
there is also a&nbsp; restart.exe in the app folder that is called by this option, 
this small&nbsp;program simply restarts the widget itself and no more.<br />
<br />DPI awareness allows the program to respond to the o/s scaling of the desktop, 
including handling the scaleable fonts so that they remain crisp and clear. Some 
prefer the old school look of non-DPI aware apps. That option is for you. If you 
have a smaller screen this option will be best, switched off.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>If you toggle between high and low DPI settings then if 
you have resized the preferences window (by dragging the bottom right corner) it 
will lose your modified size and revert to the default size.<br /><br />There are two types of tooltips used within this widget, native text tooltips 
and balloon tooltips. Enable/disable each type here as you wish.<br /><br />

fonts panel allows you to configure the fonts used in the preferences utility 
and the message boxes. Personally, I like to be able to configure the look and 
feel of my applications beyond the Windows defaults and this option allows some 
limited customisation as shown above.&nbsp;You will note the use of the&nbsp;Centurion 
Light SF at 8pt on all the menu images shown in this document. This is the 
recommended font for use with this utility giving it a suitably old-fashioned 
feel.&nbsp;You will find the Centurion Light SF font below the Steampunk 
Clock/Calendar program resources folder in the "other" directory. You install 
this font by double-clicking on the TTF file. If this font is not installed and 
selected, the default font is Times New Roman.<br /><br />The whole preference pane is resizable, you can call this an accessibilty 
feature. As you drag the bottom right corner, the whole form resizes as you 
require. The font and controls change size accordingly. The 'start' or base font 
size is shown on the left and the 'resized' font size is shown on the right.
<br /><br />The option to reactivate the message pop-ups is available to allow you to reset 
and re-enable all messages. that you have previously hidden.<br /></span>

position panel allows you to configure how the widget will operate in tablet 
mode. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Aspect Ratio Hidden Mode:&nbsp; 
</span>We suggest that you don't fiddle with this 
unless you really know what you are doing,&nbsp;unintended side effects might 
surprise you! This option was originally created for Windows on tablet devices 
and so it is not much use on standard Windows on a typical desktop system where 
the screen orientation rarely changes. Here you can choose whether the widget is 
hidden by default, in either landscape or portrait mode - or not at all. This 
option allows you to ensure this widget does not obscure the screen in one or 
the other screen modes, landscape or portrait. If you accidentally enable it so 
you can't find your widget on screen at all then change the setting here to 
NONE. If the widget is accidentally hidden then it will reappear after a set 
interval has elapsed.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Widget Position by Percent: 
</span>The widget 
can be positioned proportionally when switching between portrait/landscape.&nbsp;
<br /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Widget Position Locked. 
</span>You can turn off 
the ability to drag the program with the mouse. <br /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Widget Locked in Landscape/</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none; font-weight: bold;">Portrait</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> 
The widget can be locked into a certain position in either landscape/portrait 
mode, it ensures that the widget always appears exactly where you want it to. 
Using the fields adjacent, you can assign a default x/y position for both 
Landscape or Portrait mode. When the widget is locked in place (using the Widget 
Position Locked option in the Window Tab), this value is set automatically.<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preference Pane Position </span>The prefs panel 
itself remembers its own position. When you locate the prefs pane elsewhere on 
the desktop and click the close button, it will save the current position and 
locate the pane in that location next time the prefs are opened. Be aware that 
the prefs pane has a position stored for both high and low DPI settings, each is 
stored separately. Whenever you move the prefs pane then a timer stores the 
current position every five seconds meaning that if you kill it using the 'X' 
button top right, the position might not yet be saved. Wait a second or two 
after relocating the prefs pane.<br /></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">

window (not yet implemented) and will enable the default editor menu option.<br />
<br />It may be useful to assign a command to the dbl click function of this widget. 
Do that here. Typically, I have the date and time control panel applet in that 
location.<br /><br />It may also be useful to assign a program to run on&nbsp;the shift+dbl click function 
of this widget. <br /><br /></span>The default editor configuration option is greyed out until the DEBUG

allow it to act as such in an unobtrusive manner on the desktop.<br /><br />

<h3>Technology:&nbsp;<br />
</h3>
<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" />The 
utility was created using VB6 and the RC6/Cairo graphic wrapper from Olaf 
Schmidt. Some brief history: VB6 was once Microsoft's vaunted flagship language 
but they abandoned it. I used VB6 firstly to prove it can be done and secondly to 
reacquaint myself with the technology further. Olaf's RichClient 6 upgrades VB6 
to incorporate a 
multi-platform modern graphics engine independent of VB6 native forms.<br />
<br />
This documentation will also cover the TwinBasic version, a VB6 alternative that is 
100% VB6 language compatible&nbsp;<span class="auto-style3">that can also 
produce </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">64bit binaries</span>. The utility 
is being migrated to TwinBasic so there WILL 
be a version that is future-proof. <br />
<br />
This help file will apply to either version as 
they will all be functionally identical. This program was built upon Windows 7, in 
my opinion Microsoft's last good desktop operating system with a decent GUI - 
with no nags, no tiles nor advertising. However, I have recently migrated to 
developing to Windows 10 on 
Win10/11+ and above, just as well. It also runs and operates with no issues at 
all on all later versions of this operating system. It has also been tested on 
Linux and Mac OSX, both running Wine. <br />
&nbsp;<h3>VB6/TwinBasic Version Credits: <br />
</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
	<img alt="sauron.png" src="sauron.png" style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" title="sauron.png" />In 
	addition to using VB6, I also used&nbsp;MZ-TOOLS 3.0 &amp; ver 8.0, CodeHelp Core IDE 
	Extender Framework 2.2, vbAdvance, some of Shaggrat's IDE addins (map &amp; code 
	folder) and Rubberduck. <br />
	<br />
	In the TwinBasic version, no add-ins were used.<br />
	<br />
	This program was built with the assistance of various snippets or chunks of 
	FOSS code. VB6 has been around for so long that&nbsp;the codebase is immense. You 
	can find snippets to do this or that and I have utilised a few bits of code 
	for this dock which has sped the development process
	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">immeasurably</span>.<br />
	<br />
	Olaf Schmidt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - This tool was built using the RichClient RC6 Cairo wrapper 
	for VB6/TwinBasic. Specifically the components using transparency. &nbsp;Olaf made changes 
	to his libraries specifically for my needs - impressive. Thanks for the 
	massive effort Olaf in creating Cairo counterparts for all the native 
	VB6/TwinBasic 
	controls and giving us access to advanced features&nbsp;such as image and control 
	transparency.&nbsp;In addition, this program makes use of Olaf's PSD parser. His 
	code allows the program to make use of a Photoshop PSD file that contains 
	its transparent graphics in layered form. &nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
	Shuja Ali (codeguru.com) for his settings.ini code.<br />
	Registry reading code from ALLAPI.COM.<br />
	Rxbagain on codeguru for his Open File common dialog code without a 
	dependent OCX<br />
	si_the_geek&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for his special folder code<br />
	Elroy on VB forums for the balloon tooltips<br />
	Rod Stephens from vb-helper.com for the resizing code Some credit goes to 
	the chaps on the VB forum who answered my incessant questions without giving 
	up on me. Not in any particular order: si_the_geek, &nbsp;jmcilhinney, .paul, 
	elroy, krool, fafalone, the trick, Niya, Olaf Schmidt, passel, Shaggy Hiker, 
	Chris.E, LaVolpe to name but a few who have responded or commented. If I 
	have forgotten anyone who assisted, my apologies here.<br />
	<br />
	Finally, credit to Harry Whitfield, Emeritus Professor, University of 
	Newcastle upon Tyne, for helping me with ideas, testing and being a sounding 
	board for my ideas. I would have done none of this without him - as he is my 
	programming Yoda and my inspiration to do better.<br />

	Twerps like me create these tools and we do it for&nbsp;nothing, for free, 
	gratis. However, it makes my day when someone sends a gift, a treat or a 
	present and it inspires me to do more. In all the time that I have created 
	all these tools (thirty or more tools) I have received no more than a dozen 
	or so gifts but when someone has done so I feel like I have just inherited&nbsp;a 
	new friend. All I ask is that if you use this tool and continue to do so, 
	consider sending me something small once every few years. I have a penchant 
	for liquorice and cheap SSDs, the former is cheap and brings a smile to my 
	face, the latter has me running round the room in circles. There is a link 
	to Kofi on the right click menu.<br />
