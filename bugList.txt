Tasks to do:
============

' slider advancing/retarding time using timeShiftPercent modified not quite exponentially to shift time - wip
' in the timer, take the value of timeShiftPercent and do what to it, use logarithm to calculate the value on a curve.
' convert the .js code to do the same.

' create a property in cwOverlay and pass the time deviation to it.

' combine a new counter rotating sound recording the current Konfabulator widget.

' keypresses when clock has focus

' when in alarm mode, the analogue clock fails to display the time as stated on the alarm shown

' .VAlign on the label? not working, raised as a bug with Olaf? 0=Top, -1 and 1=Middle

   right and left keys when the alarm is raised, control the slider

'      possibly do the hrs, mins, days, month and years separately

' add time machine functionality

' investigate the accumulating shadow when moving across the transparent surface of the screen

' shadow behind cwlabel background when background screen lowered, 1. try adding a refresh, 2, try another control

' find and replace globals within classes with property GET/SETs

' look at Olaf's pendulum code
